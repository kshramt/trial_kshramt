An implementation of [Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013, JGR)](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jgrb.50179).

This code implements an O(NâˆšN) algorithm and thus is applicable to large catalogs.
A benchmark result is as follows.

```
     N  Time (s)  Command
 20000       3.2  make N_EVENTS=20000
 40000       8.5  make N_EVENTS=40000
 80000      22.7  make N_EVENTS=80000
500000     334.1  make N_EVENTS=500000
```

```
    N Time O(N^(3/2)) (s)  Time O(N^2) (s)
 1000               0.066            0.450
 2000               0.175            1.689
 4000               0.386            6.947
 8000               0.945           27.78
16000               2.421          112.3
```

# Usage

```bash
make all      # build ./zaliapin_ben_zion_2013.exe
make plot     # plot figures
make check    # run test cases
```

This code uses [GeographicLib](http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/) to compute distances between events.
You may need to edit `-I` and `-L` in `Makefile` for your environment.

You need a C++ compiler that supports C++14 features.
I checked that the code compiles with `clang++-3.8` and `clang++-3.9.1`.
