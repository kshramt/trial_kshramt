Implementation of the transformation method of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013, JGR).

This code implements an O(NâˆšN) algorithm and thus applicable to large catalogs.
Here are some numbers:

```
     N  Time (s)  Command
 20000       6.5  make N_EVENTS=20000
 40000      17.9  make N_EVENTS=40000
 80000      53.4  make N_EVENTS=80000
500000    1121.6  make N_EVENTS=500000
```

# Usage

```bash
make
```

You may need to edit `-I` and `-L` for your environment.
