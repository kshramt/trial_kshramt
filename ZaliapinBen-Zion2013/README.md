Implementation of the transformation method of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013, JGR).

This code implements O(NâˆšN) algorithm and thus applicable to large catalogs.
For example, this code took about 35 s on a notebook computer to process a catalog, which contains 20,000 events.
This machine would process a catalog with 500,000 events in about 70 minutes (I have not tested, though).

# Usage

```bash
make
```

You may need to edit `-I` and `-L` for your environment.
