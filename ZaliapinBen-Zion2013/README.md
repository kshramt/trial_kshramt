Implementation of the transformation method of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013, JGR).

This code implements an O(NâˆšN) algorithm and thus applicable to large catalogs.
For example, this code took about 6.5 s on a notebook computer to process a catalog, which contains 20,000 events.
On the same computer, it took 1121.6 s to process a catalog with 500,000 events.

# Usage

```bash
make
```

You may need to edit `-I` and `-L` for your environment.
